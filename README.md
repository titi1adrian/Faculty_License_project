# Faculty_License_project
This was the final project from Faculty in order for me to graduate.
The scope of the project was to analyze the effect of fading in Massive MIMO systems. The project is done in Matlab and in the end, all the functions are included in a GUI to be easy to use. The full documentation and the presentation of the project can be found in _tItI_V_Adrian.pdf and Licenta.pptx.
